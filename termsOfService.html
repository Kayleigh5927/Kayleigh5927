                    <h3>1. Payments & Refunds</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All payments will be made via Paypal invoicing only.</li>
                        <li>Clients are not permitted to send unsolicited payment and will be immediately refunded if done so.</li>
                        <li>Full refunds are only possible if I have yet to begin working on the artwork. Otherwise the amount is depending on work completed thus far* (see section 3)</li>
                        <li>I reserve the right to cancel and refund a commission at any time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>2. Commission Process</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will receive a rough, colored sketch at the start of each commission. At this stage you may request major edits.</li>
                        <li>Once the sketch is approved, I will begin working on the remainder of the commission.</li>
                        <li>Before finishing touches are made, you will receive one final WIP where you may request minor edits.</li>
                        <li>After final approval, any more edits will come with a fee. The only exception are mistakes made on my end, which I will fix at no addtional cost.</li>
                        <li>Once completed, you will receive a high resolution copy of the completed artwork. You may also request a low resolution copy if you plan to share the art.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>3. Timeframes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every commission is due to be completed within 90 days of payment. After which you are entitled to receive a full refuned regardless of how far in the process I am.</li>
                        <li>The actual completion time is unique to each commission based on many factors (complexity, postion in queue, LIFE etc.) </li>
                        <li>While I do my best to give a as accurate an ETA as possible, please understand that (unlike the 90 days) this is not a concrete deadline. There may be things outside of my control that may impact completion time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>4. Copyright & Usage</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clients are permitted to use commissioned work for non-commercial purposes only.</li>
                        <li>Copyright for the artwork remains with the artist. Characters belong to their respective owners.</li>
                        <li>I reserve the right to publish all of my artwork.</li>
                    </ul>
