                <h3>Rebranding</h3>
                <p>October 12th, 2024</p>
                <p>After a ton of thought, i am officially rebranding to the name Scarlet Eclipse! I will miss the name Scarlet Spectrum, i've had it forever! But, i feel that it is tied to the My Little Pony fandom. Don't get me wrong, i still love the show! However, over the years i have expanded my art to other things. For a long time i have wanted to rebrand in order to reflect that change, but i'd been too afraid to risk it. I just decided to rip the bandaid off today. I know you guys will miss the old name, but i'm still here! Same art new name, just entering a new chapter! :D

                <h3>Terms of Service page is live</h3>
                <p>July 13th, 2024</p>
                <p>I'm tired and hardly got any sleep. But on the bright side my Terms of Service page is done! The site also has a nice background now instead of the light blue I was using as a placeholder. Now I'm off to take a break. Or nap. Probably both.</p>
