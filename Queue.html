            </summary>
            <p>There are 3 main sections, Waitlist, Paid and Working on. Each having a limited number of slots available (I may adjust these numbers if I feel the need to).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When you send a commission inquiry, I will quote you the price.</li>
                <li>Upon agreement you are then added to the waitlist. (You are not expected to pay at this time)</li>
                <li>Waitlist commissions are treated as ACCEPTED. Meaning, when it is your turn I will be in contact with you and promptly be sending the invoice out, you will be expected to pay within the next 72 hours. You are allowed to back out of the list at any time before paying, or ask to be moved down if you are not ready (You are limited to 3 extensions per commission, then you will be asked to either pay or give up the slot)
                    4: Commissions are moved from one list to the next as slots become available (WAITLIST > PAID > WORKING ON).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>NOTE: Waitlisted commissions are locked by the quoted price, if you want changes to your commission that will largely effect the price, your position will be reset to the bottom of the list. Likewise, if the change does not effect the price or does so very little you may maintain your position. Why this rule? If someone asks for a colored sketch, and then once they are at the top of the list they decided to change their idea completely to a complex scene with 5 characters, that just isn't fair.</p>
